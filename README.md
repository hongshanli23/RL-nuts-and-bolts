# Nuts and bolts of reinforcement learning algorithms

It just means each algorithm is acompanied by explanation of 
implementation details and messing around with hyperparameters 
to see what happens (in jupyter notebooks).
For each algorithm, I will try to include a version of implementation that it is compatible with Amazon SageMaker.
