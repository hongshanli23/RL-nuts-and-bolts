# Nuts and bolts of reinforcement learning algorithms

Pytorch implementations of RL algorithms. 
* Common utilities applicable to all RL algorithms can be found in [rlkits](rlkits).
* Algorithms can be found in [rlalgos](rlalgos)
* Notes about the algorithms can be found in [theory](theory)
* Examples can be found in [example](./examples)
* Experiments in Jupyter notebooks can be found in [notebooks](./notebooks)


To install the package
```sh
pip install -e .
```
